🚲 TwoWheeler Risk Analyzer

YOLO-based Two-Wheeler Detection and Risk Analysis System

This project analyzes traffic scenes to detect two-wheeler vehicles (motorcycles, bicycles) and evaluate potential risk situations using computer vision techniques.

The system combines YOLO-based object detection, motion analysis, and custom risk evaluation logic to provide a modular and extensible risk analysis pipeline.

✨ Features

YOLO-based object detection

Motion analysis using dense optical flow

Risk scoring based on scene dynamics

Real-time visualization of detected risks

Modular and easy-to-extend Python codebase
